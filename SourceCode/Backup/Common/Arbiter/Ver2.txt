+ Allow messages to be sent trough reference locally [optinally] to increase speed. Have a thread protection mechanism for accessing them.
+ Have an advanced integrated addressing mechanism that allows complex sending operations.

+ Operation helper should be integrated with the default client and be available if case needs.

+ Provide a NON - wcf channel for communication (faster).

+ Enable WCF tracing
//TraceSwitch s = new TraceSwitch("a", "a");
//s.Level = TraceLevel.Info;

//System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener listener = new TextWriterTraceListener("d:\\txt.txt");
//Trace.Listeners.Add(listener);

+ Make messages be Struct [??], and have no reference members. This way they can be copied very fast.
+ Make an specialized "envlope" that has the purpose to deliver the message, and remove all the transporting information from the message itself.
